<strong>Mardi Gras</strong> - This is French for &ldquo;Fat Tuesday&rdquo;, a  reference to the fact that Mardi gras always is the day before Ash Wednesday,  the beginning of Lent in the Catholic faith. Because the 40 days of Lent are  considered a somber period of sacrifice, Fat Tuesday is seen by many as an  appropriate time for indulgence and festivity- a last chance at revelry.  Nowhere in the United States is Mardi gras celebrated as it is in Louisiana.<br />
<strong>Carnival-</strong> This word is not interchangeable with  &ldquo;Mardi Gras&rdquo;. Carnival refers to the whole period of time leading up to Fat  Tuesday. The Carnival season officially begins on the Feast of the Epiphany.  This date is also known as Twelfth Night (12 days after Christmas). Festivities  kick off on a small scale at this time, then gradually pick up steam, peaking  with many parades, balls and parties on the final two weekends before Mardi gras.<br />
<strong>Krewe-</strong> This is a Carnival organization made up  of members who plan and carry out the various themed parades and balls. The  Krewe of Rex, for instance, honors the &ldquo;king&rdquo; of Carnival and stages a  spectacular, traditional parade on Mardi gras, along with an elaborate ball  later that night. IN keeping with the &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; tradition of Carnival, some of  the oldest krewes keep their membership shrouded in secrecy. This is why krewes  require members to wear masks during parades. (Wearing masks and costumes is  also part of the fun for everyone else.) In addition to their Carnival  activities, many krewes also participate in charitable efforts throughout the  year. <br />
<strong>Parade</strong>- Ok, everybody knows what this is, but  if you haven&rsquo;t seen a Mardi gras parade, well, you haven&rsquo;t seen a parade. For  New Orleans parades, krewes build huge, elaborate floats that carry riders who  may number in the dozens. The spectacle of these events is something to behold,  and spectators get a bonus thrill as float riders toss loads of colorful  trinkets along the way.<br />
<strong>Throws</strong>- We call the parade trinkets &ldquo;throws.&rdquo;  The most common throws are strings of plastic beads that parade goers love to  collect and wear around their necks as &ldquo;trophies&rdquo; from their parade experience.  Each Krewe usually also throws medallions, small toys or plastic cups imprinted  with the Krewe logo.<br />
<strong>Purple, green and gold-</strong> These are the  &ldquo;official&rdquo; colors of Mardi gras, and you&rsquo;ll see them everywhere. According to  some Carnival historians, purple represents justice, green is faith and gold is  power<br />
<strong>King Cake-</strong> You&rsquo;ll want to sample this Carnival  tradition for sure. Sweet dough twisted and shaped into an oblong is heavily  decorated with icing and purple, green and gold sugar crystals. King cake is  actually more bread than cake. Be alert: By Tradition, a plastic baby is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;  in every king cake, and if you happen to find it in your slice, you are  responsible for providing the next king cake for the party!
